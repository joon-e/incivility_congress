487,"Jenniffer González anuncia inclusión de Puerto Rico en el Pandemic-EBT que da mayor acceso a asistencia nutricional a estudiantes El programa está incluido en la Resolución Continua aprobada por el Senado que busca evitar un cierre del gobierno federal 30 de septiembre de 2020, Washington, D.C. – El Senado federal aprobó hoy la Resolución Continua de Presupuesto, el cual incluye a Puerto Rico bajo el programa de asistencia nutricional Pandemic-EBT (P-EBT), operado por la agencia “Food and Nutrition Service” del Departamento de Agricultura federal (USDA por sus siglas en inglés), así lo informo la comisionada residente, Jenniffer González Colón, quien desde los inicios de la pandemia abogó por la inclusión de la Isla en el programa que ayudará a que los estudiantes afectados por los cierres escolares relacionados al COVID-19 tengan mayor acceso a asistencia nutricional. La resolución pasa ahora a la firma del presidente, Donald Trump. P-EBT está disponible como una de las alternativas para proveer beneficios nutricionales a estudiantes ubicados en jurisdicciones que operan el Programa de Asistencia Nutricional Suplementaria- conocido como SNAP por sus siglas en inglés, y que se han visto afectados por cierres escolares durante el semestre por el COVID-19. Al no participar en SNAP, Puerto Rico originalmente quedó fuera de esta iniciativa, junto a los territorios de Samoa Americana y las Islas Marianas del Norte. Al lograr trato igualitario, Puerto Rico estará mejor posicionado para ofrecer asistencia nutricional a sobre 280,000 estudiantes. El programa permite que hogares con estudiantes afectados por los cierres de escuelas, y que por ende no están recibiendo alimentos durante horarios escolares regulares, puedan recibir un beneficio económico por medio del sistema EBT. Este es el mismo sistema de tarjeta que utiliza el Departamento de la Familia para administrar los beneficios mensuales del programa del Programa de Asistencia Nutricional (PAN). “El incluir a Puerto Rico bajo el programa P-EBT ha sido una de mis prioridades durante las negociaciones de los paquetes de ayuda por la pandemia. Hoy me place anunciar que el Senado federal acaba de aprobar la Resolución Continua de Presupuesto que incluye nuestra petición para que los estudiantes de Puerto Rico puedan recibir un beneficio nutricional por medio de este programa. La resolución va camino a recibir la firma del Presidente Trump”, informó la comisionada residente. Puerto Rico podría continuar ofreciendo alimentos de comedores escolares, a pesar de los cierres de escuelas, por medio de métodos alternos y a su vez ofrecer ayuda económica a familias con niños afectados. “P-EBT fue creado para abarcar las necesidades nutricionales de los estudiantes afectados por el COVID-19. En nuestro caso, muchos estudiantes dependen de sus escuelas para recibir la mayoría de sus comidas diarias. Esta iniciativa se sumaría a las alternativas disponibles para asegurarnos que nuestros niños puedan alimentarse debidamente durante la pandemia”, expresó la comisionada. Desde el comienzo de la pandemia y negociaciones para ofrecer asistencia, la comisionada residente abogó a través de misivas y conversaciones con el liderato de la Cámara y el Senado para incluir a la Isla en el programa P-EBT como parte de los paquetes de ayudas para atender el coronavirus. La Resolución Continua también expande el término de P-EBT hasta 2021. ###","civil","Own Data",990487

Obama studied Socialism at Columbia University, while Hillary learned Alinsky's methods at Wellesley College. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, Obama worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1969, Hillary Rodham wrote a 92-page senior thesis for Wellesley College about community organizer Saul Alinsky entitled ""There Is Only the Fight . . . "": An Analysis of the Alinsky Model.  iconoclast - noun  a person who attacks cherished beliefs or institutions.  How to create a social state by Saul Alinsky:  There are 8 levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state.   The first is the most important.  1) Healthcare — Control healthcare and you control the people  2) Poverty — Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.  3) Debt — Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.  4) Gun Control — Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state.  5) Welfare — Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).  6) Education — Take control of what people read and listen to — take control of what children learn in school.  7) Religion — Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools.  8) Class Warfare — Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.   Does any of this sound like what is happening to the United States?

MCCONNEL MADE IT CLEAR TRUMP IS A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT YOU ARE CURRENTLY SCHEMING WITH TO ADVANCE YOUR POLITICAL FUTURE.   ON JANUARY 6, 2021, TRUMP COMMITTED THE FOLLOWING CRIMES: 1. SEDITION: Inciting a riot. 2. Orchestrating an insurrection form the purpose of retaining control of the Presidency, this subverting Democracy. 3. He violated U.S. code 1038 (False Statements and Hoaxes) at least six times during his presidency, but his “Stop the Steal” disinformation operation will make the history books. 4. This next passage is self-explanatory: ““When a violent mob stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, then-President Donald Trump was engaged a screaming match with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, refusing to tell the rioters to stand down, according to a new report. The argument happened over an expletive-laced phone call after McCarthy insisted that the rioters were Trump supporters and begged him to call them off, CNN reported on Friday. ""Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are,"" Trump said, according to lawmakers who were briefed on the call by McCarthy and spoke to the outlet. McCarthy then furiously told Trump that rioters were breaking into his office through a window, snapping back, ""Who the f— do you think you are talking to?"" a Republican lawmaker familiar with the call told CNN.” This ordeal was added to the impeachment record. 5. Since Trump did not comply with his oath of office, he was derelict of duty. 6. Trump was fully aware of the situation, which means he committed criminal negligence, reckless endangerment, and negligent homicide. 7. He complimented the terrorists who were searching for members of Congress to assassinate. 8. He complimented the instructions who erected a gallows and chanted, “HANG MIKE PENCE”. 9. GIVING COMFORT OR AID TO TERRORISTS, WHO WERE PLANNING TO COMPLETE TRUMP’S COUP IS TREASON. 10. WHEN YOU LOOKED THE OTHER WAY, OR WAS COMPLICIT, IN DEVIN NUNES COMMITTING TEXTBOOK OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE AND CONGRESS, YOU BECAME A NATIONAL SECURITY BREACH.  THE TRUTH IS KEVIN MCCARTHY, YOU SHOULD BE THE ONE STEPPING DOWN.  DEMOCRATS DID REPUBLICANS A FAVOR. IF NATIONAL SECURITY WAS SUCH A PRIORITY, AND WE USED HIS ARGUMENTS OF WHY SWALWELL SHOULD BE REMOVED, THERE ARE HIGH-RANKING MEMBERS OF SENATE WHO RECEIVED “DONATIONS” FROM RUSSIANS.

He has done his part by nominating Judge Amy Coney Barrett. She has had her hearing, sitting for hours listening to Democratics spouting political rhetoric - not asking any substantive questions which is the purpose of a hearing. Examine the word itself ""HEARING"", listening and not pontificating. There has been not one thing in her character or record found negative.  I would hope that you do not continue to make this process political. It is time to do your part, like West Virginians expected you to do when we elected you. Vote on this nomination,  either up or down.

Como informó Breitbart News el martes, Scott está circulando un plan de amnistía que pretende beneficiar a los extranjeros ilegales inscritos y elegibles para el programa de Acción Diferida para los Llegados en la Infancia (DACA) del ex presidente Obama.  Un análisis publicado por la Federación para la Reforma de la Inmigración Estadounidense (FAIR, por sus siglas en inglés) revela que el plan de Scott podría poner a aproximadamente 1,5 millones de extranjeros ilegales en una vía rápida para obtener la ciudadanía estadounidense en unos 15 años, o para el año 2036.  ""El proyecto de ley proporciona amnistía y un camino hacia la ciudadanía a una población de extranjeros mucho más amplia que los beneficiarios de DACA"", afirma el análisis de FAIR:  Según los términos de este proyecto de ley, todos los extranjeros ilegales que eran técnicamente elegibles para solicitar DACA son elegibles para la amnistía y una tarjeta verde. Esto incluye incluso a aquellos que no se molestaron en postularse en 2012 cuando la administración Obama creó ilegalmente el programa a través de un memorando ejecutivo.  Si bien el plan de Scott incluye disposiciones para asegurar la financiación de un ""sistema de muro fronterizo"", el análisis FAIR llama a los componentes ""sin dientes"" y señala que la amnistía es a menudo la más vulnerable al fraude.  ""El proyecto de ley tampoco obstaculiza la capacidad de un extranjero de presentar solicitudes de asilo fraudulentas o frívolas ... el fraude de amnistía es el método principal que utilizan los extranjeros ilegales para ingresar a los Estados Unidos, independientemente de los muros y estructuras fronterizas existentes"", afirma el análisis.  La representante María Elvira Salazar (R-FL) está lista para proponer un plan de amnistía más amplio en la Cámara esta semana, como detalló en una entrevista el 2 de marzo.  Scott está haciendo circular el plan de amnistía justo cuando la inmigración ilegal a los Estados Unidos se ha disparado durante el primer mes y medio de la administración del presidente Joe Biden.  El mes pasado, los funcionarios federales de inmigración detuvieron a casi 100,000 personas que cruzaban la frontera, un aumento del 170 por ciento en comparación con el mismo período del año pasado.","civil","Own Data",990468

That is $17.43/hr.  Just to barely scrape by.  As you can see, I did not include ANY entertainment money, or if I was a parent, how much more that would be needed to survive while raising a child.  I also did not include any actual healthcare costs.  Like copays, surgeries, prescriptions.  That also would make the number needed to survive in this current economy a lot higher.  Now I do know that you can get a prepaid phone for cheaper around $50/mo, also I have found ONE apartment cheaper at $700/mo.  And I could lower my transportation to $120/mo. by getting rid of my car and strictly using the city bus.  So, with those numbers, the average amount a person needs to make a month is $2,284.  Or that equals $14.23/hr.  And remember, that is only just to barely scrape by, as I did not include any education expenses, as in going to college.  That would also require more money.  “I grew up in the suburbs.  I used to think that I could write a prescription for a poor man: ‘Get a job, save your money, pull yourself up by the bootstraps.’  I don’t believe that anymore.  I was ignorant to the experiences of poor people.  I’d invite anyone to come and meet the people who live in this neighborhood.  Right now we are surrounded by working poor people.  These are the people who sell your tools at Sears, and fix your roofs, and take care of your parents, and mow your lawns, and serve your meals.  They’re not getting a living wage.  There’s no money left to save.  There’s nothing left if they get sick.  Nothing left if their car breaks down.  And God forbid they make a mistake, because there’s nothing left to pay fines or fees.  When you’re down here, the system will continue to kick dirt in your face.  You can’t pull yourself up when there’s nothing to grab onto.  We aren’t paying our brothers and sisters enough to live.  We want them to serve us, but we aren’t serving them.”","civil","Own Data",992542
