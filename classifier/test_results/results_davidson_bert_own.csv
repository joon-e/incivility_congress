La resoluci√≥n pasa ahora a la firma del presidente, Donald Trump. P-EBT est√° disponible como una de las alternativas para proveer beneficios nutricionales a estudiantes ubicados en jurisdicciones que operan el Programa de Asistencia Nutricional Suplementaria- conocido como SNAP por sus siglas en ingl√©s, y que se han visto afectados por cierres escolares durante el semestre por el COVID-19. Al no participar en SNAP, Puerto Rico originalmente qued√≥ fuera de esta iniciativa, junto a los territorios de Samoa Americana y las Islas Marianas del Norte. Al lograr trato igualitario, Puerto Rico estar√° mejor posicionado para ofrecer asistencia nutricional a sobre 280,000 estudiantes. El programa permite que hogares con estudiantes afectados por los cierres de escuelas, y que por ende no est√°n recibiendo alimentos durante horarios escolares regulares, puedan recibir un beneficio econ√≥mico por medio del sistema EBT. Este es el mismo sistema de tarjeta que utiliza el Departamento de la Familia para administrar los beneficios mensuales del programa del Programa de Asistencia Nutricional (PAN). ‚ÄúEl incluir a Puerto Rico bajo el programa P-EBT ha sido una de mis prioridades durante las negociaciones de los paquetes de ayuda por la pandemia. Hoy me place anunciar que el Senado federal acaba de aprobar la Resoluci√≥n Continua de Presupuesto que incluye nuestra petici√≥n para que los estudiantes de Puerto Rico puedan recibir un beneficio nutricional por medio de este programa. La resoluci√≥n va camino a recibir la firma del Presidente Trump‚Äù, inform√≥ la comisionada residente. Puerto Rico podr√≠a continuar ofreciendo alimentos de comedores escolares, a pesar de los cierres de escuelas, por medio de m√©todos alternos y a su vez ofrecer ayuda econ√≥mica a familias con ni√±os afectados. ‚ÄúP-EBT fue creado para abarcar las necesidades nutricionales de los estudiantes afectados por el COVID-19. En nuestro caso, muchos estudiantes dependen de sus escuelas para recibir la mayor√≠a de sus comidas diarias. Esta iniciativa se sumar√≠a a las alternativas disponibles para asegurarnos que nuestros ni√±os puedan alimentarse debidamente durante la pandemia‚Äù, expres√≥ la comisionada. Desde el comienzo de la pandemia y negociaciones para ofrecer asistencia, la comisionada residente abog√≥ a trav√©s de misivas y conversaciones con el liderato de la C√°mara y el Senado para incluir a la Isla en el programa P-EBT como parte de los paquetes de ayudas para atender el coronavirus. La Resoluci√≥n Continua tambi√©n expande el t√©rmino de P-EBT hasta 2021. ###",civil,Own Data,487,990487,civil,0.997901439666748

Today, I voted to decriminalize marijuana and help undo damage inflicted by the failed, racist war on drugs. The bill we passed makes previously jailed individuals eligible for educational, financial, and employment opportunities currently unavailable to them by clearing low-level cannabis offenses from their record. It also also changes the way the government categorizes marijuana, allowing states to set their own laws without federal interference.

"": An Analysis of the Alinsky Model.  iconoclast - noun  a person who attacks cherished beliefs or institutions.  How to create a social state by Saul Alinsky:  There are 8 levels of control that must be obtained before you are able to create a social state.   The first is the most important.  1) Healthcare ‚Äî Control healthcare and you control the people  2) Poverty ‚Äî Increase the Poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.  3) Debt ‚Äî Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.  4) Gun Control ‚Äî Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state.  5) Welfare ‚Äî Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).  6) Education ‚Äî Take control of what people read and listen to ‚Äî take control of what children learn in school.  7) Religion ‚Äî Remove the belief in the God from the Government and schools.  8) Class Warfare ‚Äî Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (Tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.   Does any of this sound like what is happening to the United States?

MCCONNEL MADE IT CLEAR TRUMP IS A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT YOU ARE CURRENTLY SCHEMING WITH TO ADVANCE YOUR POLITICAL FUTURE.   ON JANUARY 6, 2021, TRUMP COMMITTED THE FOLLOWING CRIMES: 1. SEDITION: Inciting a riot. 2. Orchestrating an insurrection form the purpose of retaining control of the Presidency, this subverting Democracy. 3. He violated U.S. code 1038 (False Statements and Hoaxes) at least six times during his presidency, but his ‚ÄúStop the Steal‚Äù disinformation operation will make the history books. 4. This next passage is self-explanatory: ‚Äú‚ÄúWhen a violent mob stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, then-President Donald Trump was engaged a screaming match with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, refusing to tell the rioters to stand down, according to a new report. The argument happened over an expletive-laced phone call after McCarthy insisted that the rioters were Trump supporters and begged him to call them off, CNN reported on Friday. ""Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are,"" Trump said, according to lawmakers who were briefed on the call by McCarthy and spoke to the outlet. McCarthy then furiously told Trump that rioters were breaking into his office through a window, snapping back, ""Who the f‚Äî do you think you are talking to?"" a Republican lawmaker familiar with the call told CNN.‚Äù This ordeal was added to the impeachment record. 5. Since Trump did not comply with his oath of office, he was derelict of duty. 6. Trump was fully aware of the situation, which means he committed criminal negligence, reckless endangerment, and negligent homicide. 7. He complimented the terrorists who were searching for members of Congress to assassinate. 8. He complimented the instructions who erected a gallows and chanted, ‚ÄúHANG MIKE PENCE‚Äù. 9. GIVING COMFORT OR AID TO TERRORISTS, WHO WERE PLANNING TO COMPLETE TRUMP‚ÄôS COUP IS TREASON. 10. WHEN YOU LOOKED THE OTHER WAY, OR WAS COMPLICIT, IN DEVIN NUNES COMMITTING TEXTBOOK OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE AND CONGRESS, YOU BECAME A NATIONAL SECURITY BREACH.  THE TRUTH IS KEVIN MCCARTHY, YOU SHOULD BE THE ONE STEPPING DOWN.  DEMOCRATS DID REPUBLICANS A FAVOR. IF NATIONAL SECURITY WAS SUCH A PRIORITY, AND WE USED HIS ARGUMENTS OF WHY SWALWELL SHOULD BE REMOVED, THERE ARE HIGH-RANKING MEMBERS OF SENATE WHO RECEIVED ‚ÄúDONATIONS‚Äù FROM RUSSIANS.

Como inform√≥ Breitbart News el martes, Scott est√° circulando un plan de amnist√≠a que pretende beneficiar a los extranjeros ilegales inscritos y elegibles para el programa de Acci√≥n Diferida para los Llegados en la Infancia (DACA) del ex presidente Obama.  Un an√°lisis publicado por la Federaci√≥n para la Reforma de la Inmigraci√≥n Estadounidense (FAIR, por sus siglas en ingl√©s) revela que el plan de Scott podr√≠a poner a aproximadamente 1,5 millones de extranjeros ilegales en una v√≠a r√°pida para obtener la ciudadan√≠a estadounidense en unos 15 a√±os, o para el a√±o 2036.  ""El proyecto de ley proporciona amnist√≠a y un camino hacia la ciudadan√≠a a una poblaci√≥n de extranjeros mucho m√°s amplia que los beneficiarios de DACA"", afirma el an√°lisis de FAIR:  Seg√∫n los t√©rminos de este proyecto de ley, todos los extranjeros ilegales que eran t√©cnicamente elegibles para solicitar DACA son elegibles para la amnist√≠a y una tarjeta verde. Esto incluye incluso a aquellos que no se molestaron en postularse en 2012 cuando la administraci√≥n Obama cre√≥ ilegalmente el programa a trav√©s de un memorando ejecutivo.  Si bien el plan de Scott incluye disposiciones para asegurar la financiaci√≥n de un ""sistema de muro fronterizo"", el an√°lisis FAIR llama a los componentes ""sin dientes"" y se√±ala que la amnist√≠a es a menudo la m√°s vulnerable al fraude.  ""El proyecto de ley tampoco obstaculiza la capacidad de un extranjero de presentar solicitudes de asilo fraudulentas o fr√≠volas ... el fraude de amnist√≠a es el m√©todo principal que utilizan los extranjeros ilegales para ingresar a los Estados Unidos, independientemente de los muros y estructuras fronterizas existentes"", afirma el an√°lisis.  La representante Mar√≠a Elvira Salazar (R-FL) est√° lista para proponer un plan de amnist√≠a m√°s amplio en la C√°mara esta semana, como detall√≥ en una entrevista el 2 de marzo.  Scott est√° haciendo circular el plan de amnist√≠a justo cuando la inmigraci√≥n ilegal a los Estados Unidos se ha disparado durante el primer mes y medio de la administraci√≥n del presidente Joe Biden.  El mes pasado, los funcionarios federales de inmigraci√≥n detuvieron a casi 100,000 personas que cruzaban la frontera, un aumento del 170 por ciento en comparaci√≥n con el mismo per√≠odo del a√±o pasado.",civil,Own Data,468,990468,civil,0.9992088675498962

That is $17.43/hr.  Just to barely scrape by.  As you can see, I did not include ANY entertainment money, or if I was a parent, how much more that would be needed to survive while raising a child.  I also did not include any actual healthcare costs.  Like copays, surgeries, prescriptions.  That also would make the number needed to survive in this current economy a lot higher.  Now I do know that you can get a prepaid phone for cheaper around $50/mo, also I have found ONE apartment cheaper at $700/mo.  And I could lower my transportation to $120/mo. by getting rid of my car and strictly using the city bus.  So, with those numbers, the average amount a person needs to make a month is $2,284.  Or that equals $14.23/hr.  And remember, that is only just to barely scrape by, as I did not include any education expenses, as in going to college.  That would also require more money.  ‚ÄúI grew up in the suburbs.  I used to think that I could write a prescription for a poor man: ‚ÄòGet a job, save your money, pull yourself up by the bootstraps.‚Äô  I don‚Äôt believe that anymore.  I was ignorant to the experiences of poor people.  I‚Äôd invite anyone to come and meet the people who live in this neighborhood.  Right now we are surrounded by working poor people.  These are the people who sell your tools at Sears, and fix your roofs, and take care of your parents, and mow your lawns, and serve your meals.  They‚Äôre not getting a living wage.  There‚Äôs no money left to save.  There‚Äôs nothing left if they get sick.  Nothing left if their car breaks down.  And God forbid they make a mistake, because there‚Äôs nothing left to pay fines or fees.  When you‚Äôre down here, the system will continue to kick dirt in your face.
